# Braille-to-Speech-Converter
Technical Answers for Real World Problems (CSE1901) J Component

## Steps to be followed:
#### 1. Creating a user-friendly interface:
The user would be able to convert braille into speech here.
#### 2. Braille image acquisition:
The user can directly upload braille image scripts of their choice for conversion.
#### 3. Image processing:
The Braille input image should be processed in a way that is convenient to read, and it is done by using methods in OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library, which is primarily aimed toward a real-time PC vision. To identify the braille letters, we will use an OBR model with our dataset.
#### 4. Text to Speech:
The Braille to speech converter explores a python module that translates braille input images into text which is converted to speech, using Speech Synthesizer of Web Speech API. The principal objective of this task is to set up a means of reading comprehension for specially-abled people.
